 <p class="aboutme">In September 2018, Aleesha had just moved into a new flat and felt a bit lonely, so she decided to go to 
 the pet shop and look at the hamsters. <br> When she
 arrived she first went to look at the tiny baby Roborovskis, but they were all sleeping and didn't want to come out.
 She looked around a bit more and saw a display with a notice about adoption on it, the notice said the hamster inside
 had been given up by their old owner and needed a new home.<br> The hamster inside was cheeky and active. He was running
 around the tiny display cage as if he wanted to escape and run around the shop. The notice said his name was Squidge.</p>

 <p class="aboutme">My cute little face was irresistable and Aleesha decided that she had to adopt me. She picked out a cage and toys
 and asked a staff member to take me out for her to take home.<br> I was put inside 2 cardboard boxes to make sure
 I didn't get out until we got home. Well that didn't stop me, I had chewed my way out of both boxes before we
 even got home, and was exploring my empty new cage.<br> Aleesha should have known then that I was a troublemaker!</p>

 <p class="aboutme">Since that first incident, I have escaped from my cage loads of times, 
     after I got out I usually ran off into a corner of the living room and made
     a nest out of ripped-up paper, luckily none of the things I chewed were important!<br><br> Once, when Aleesha let me
     free roam in the kitchen, I escaped behind the dishwasher into the wall. Aleesha was terrified! She had to remove
     a bit of the wall to get me out again! I was dusty and dishevelled but not really bothered by it, while Aleesha 
     was crying her eyes out thinking I was gone for good! I just love exploring, especially places I'm not supposed to!</p>
